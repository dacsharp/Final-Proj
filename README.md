 <!-- ABOUT THE PROGRAM -->
 ## About The Programs

The game is a simple Flappy Bird and Mario mashup. As the user navigates through pipes they have to shoot the bricks falling from the sky. The bricks are color coded as Fire and Ice and must be hit with the respective bullets that the player can shoot. 

The game features a built in media player that is currently setup to play lo-fi music for ambiance.
